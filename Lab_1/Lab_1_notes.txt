GS/s Gigasamples per second
100Mhz:  it determines the maximum frequency that the instrument can accurately measure. Bandwidth is also a key determining factor in price. For example, a 100 MHz oscilloscope is usually guaranteed to have less than 30% attenuation at 100 MHz.

freq is mentioned
amplitude (Vpp voltage peak to peak) and phase is also mentioned

BNC to BNC cable
cable has male connectors

system has female connectors

the channels on DSO numbered

after connecting to the oscilloscope we should autoset it once

Position knob can be used to move the wave form up and down

Scale knob scales up or down the input signal.

Coupling:
AC data is through AC Path only AC signal is availble
DC data is through DC path and both AC and DC are visible

BandWidth limit:
it displays the input till the bandwidth value if it is on and nothing above that

volts/div:
coarse signal or fine signal
scale can be adjusted finely or coarsely

Probe 1X voltage:
voltage, current, Attenuation
attenuation: attenuated by n times and displayed

Invert:
inverts the input signal

delta V :
it is the diff between the cursor 1 and cursor 2

Why peak to peak value is different from the generated signal to measured signal
